tesla_dashcam
=============

Python program that provides an easy method to merge saved Tesla Dashcam footage into a single video.

When saving Tesla Dashcam footage a folder is created on the USB drive and within it multiple MP4 video files are
created. Currently the dashcam leverages four (4) cameras (front, rear, left repeater, and right repeater) and will create a
file for each of them. Every minute is stored into a separate file as well. This means that when saving dashcam footage
there is a total of 40 files video files for every 10 minutes. Each block of 10 minutes is put into a folder, thus often
there will be multiple folders.

Using this program, one can combine all of these into 1 video file. The video of the four cameras is merged
into one picture, with the video for all the minutes further put together into one.

By default sub-folders are included when retrieving the video clips. One can, for example, just provide the path to the
respective SavedClips folder (i.e. e:\\TeslaCam\\SavedClips for Windows if drive has letter E,
/Volumes/Tesla/TeslaCam/SavedClips on MacOS if drive is mounted on /Volumes/Tesla) and then all folders that were created
within the SavedClips folder will be processed. There will be a movie file for each folder.
When using the option --merge there will also be a movie file created combining the movies from all the folders into 1.
Use parameter --exclude_subdirs to only scan the folder provided and not any of the sub-folders.

There is also the option to monitor for a disk to become available with the TeslaCam folder on it. Video files will be
automatically processed once the USB (or SD) drive has been inserted. After processing the program will wait again until
this drive has been ejected and then a new one is inserted at which point it will start processing again (unless
--monitor_once parameter was used in which case the program will exit).
Note processing will occur if the drive is already inserted and the program is then started with this option.

When using the --monitor (or --monitor_once) option, video files from a folder will not be re-processed if the movie
file for that folder already exist.
It is still possible for --monitor_once to provide a output filename instead of just a folder. For --monitor the filename
will be ignored and the files will be created within the path specified using a unique name instead.

Using the option --monitor_trigger_file one can have it check for existence of a certain file or folder for starting
processing instead of waiting for the disk with the TeslaCam folder to become available. Once available processing will
start, if a trigger file was provided then upon completion of processing the file will then be deleted. If it was a folder
then it will wait for the folder to be removed by something else (or for example link removed) and then wait again for it
to appear again.
If no source folder is provided then folder SavedClips will be processed with assumption it is in the same location as
the trigger file. If source folder is an absolute path (i.e. /Videos/Tesla) then that will be used as source location.
If it is a relative path (i.e. Tesla/MyVideos) then the path will be considered to be relative based on the location
provided for the trigger file.

When using --merge, the name of the resulting video file will be appended with the current timestamp of processing when
--monitor parameter is used, this to ensure that the resulting video file is always unique.
Option --chapter_offset can be provided to offset the chapter markers within the merged video. A negative number would
result in the chapter marker being set not at the start for the folder video but instead be set provided number of
seconds before the end of that video. For example, with 10 minute video for a folder a value of -120 would result
in the chapter markers being set 2 minutes before the end of that video. A positive number will result in chapter marker
being set to provided number of seconds after the start of the video. Value of 600 would result in chapter markers being
set 5 minutes into that folder's video.

If --merge is not provided as an option and there are multiple sub-folders then the filename (if provided in output)
will be ignored. Instead the files will all be placed in the folder identified by the output parameter, one movie file
for each folder. Only exception to this if there was only 1 folder.

By default created videos will be stored within the Tesla_Dashcam folder in the Videos folder (Windows), Movies folder (MacOS), or Videos folder within the user's home directory (Linux).
This can be overriden using the --output parameter.

If no source has been provided then it would be the same as providing parameters --monitor_once and SavedClips as source.
This means that the program will wait until it discovers the USB or SD card with the TeslaCam folder is present and once present it will
start processing all the folders within the SavedClips folder. Once processing of all folders is complete it will then exit.

Notes
-----

The video files for the same minute between the 4 cameras are not always the same length. If there is a difference in
their duration then a black screen will be shown for the camera which video ended before the others (within the minute).
It is thus possible within a video to see a black screen for one of the cameras, and then when that minute has passed
for it to show video again.

The date and time shown within the video comes from the timestamp embedded in the saved videos themselves, not from the
filename. Date and time shown within video is based on PC's timezone.
Tesla embeds the date and time within the video file, and that is what will be displayed comes. This means that the video might
not start exactly at 0 seconds. In the provided video examples one can see that it starts at 16:42:35 and not 16:42:00.

Current caveat however is that the order for concatenating all the videos together is based on filename. (See TODO)

Requirements
-------------

This package relies on `ffmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org>`__ to be installed, this is a free, open source cross-platform
solution to convert video. The created executables for Windows and MacOS include an ffmpeg version.

If not using the executables (Windows and MacOS) then `Python <https://www.python.org>`__ 3.7 or higher is required.


Installation
-------------

Downloading the respective bundle (ZIP for Windows, DMG for MacOS) and unpacking this in a location of your choosing is
sufficient to install this.

If downloading the source files (i.e. for Linux) then Python has to be installed as well. I recommend in that case to
install the package from pypi using pip to ensure all package requirements (except for ffmpeg) are met.

This package is available from `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/tesla-dashcam/>`__.

Install from pypi is done through:

.. code:: bash

    pip install tesla_dashcam

                             (default: x264)
      --enc ENC             Provide a custom encoding for video creation.
                            Note: when using this option the --gpu option is ignored. To use GPU hardware acceleration specify a encoding that provides this. (default: None)
      --no-gpu (MAC)        Use GPU acceleration, only enable if supported by hardware.

    Video Quality:
      Options for resulting video quality and size:

      --quality {LOWEST,LOWER,LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH}
                            Define the quality setting for the video, higher
                            quality means bigger file size but might not be
                            noticeable. (default: LOWER)
      --compression {ultrafast,superfast,veryfast,faster,fast,medium,slow,slower,veryslow}
                            Speed to optimize video. Faster speed results in a
                            bigger file. This does not impact the quality of the
                            video, just how much time is used to compress it.
                            (default: medium)

    Monitor for TeslaDash Cam drive:
      Parameters to monitor for a drive to be attached with folder TeslaCam in
      the root.

      --monitor             Enable monitoring for drive to be attached with
                            TeslaCam folder. (default: False)
      --monitor_once        Enable monitoring and exit once drive with TeslaCam
                            folder has been attached and files processed.
                            (default: False)
      --monitor_trigger MONITOR_TRIGGER
                            Trigger file to look for instead of waiting for drive
                            to be attached. Once file is discovered then

Enable monitoring for the Tesla Dashcam USB (or SD) to be inserted and then process all the files (both RecentClips and SavedClips).
Increase speed of resulting videos tenfold and store all videos in folder specified by output.
Delete the source files afterwards:


.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam.exe --speed 10 --output c:\Tesla\ --monitor .

* Mac:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam /Users/me/Desktop/Tesla --monitor .

* Linux:

.. code:: bash

    python3 tesla_dashcam.py /home/me/Desktop/Tesla --monitor .


Enable one-time monitoring for the Tesla Dashcam USB (or SD) to be inserted and then process all the files from SavedClips.
Note that for source we provide the folder name (SavedClips), the complete path will be created by the program.
Slowdown speed of resulting videos to half, show left/right cameras as if looking backwards, store all videos in folder specified by output.
Also create a movie file that has them all merged together.

* Windows:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam.exe --slowdown 2 --rear --merge --output c:\Tesla\ --monitor_once SavedClips

* Mac:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam --slowdown 2 --rear --merge --output /Users/me/Desktop/Tesla --monitor_once SavedClips

* Linux:

.. code:: bash

    python3 tesla_dashcam.py --slowdown 2 --rear --merge --output /home/me/Tesla --monitor_once SavedClips

Enable monitoring using a trigger file (or folder) to start processing all the files from SavedClips.
Note that for source we provide the folder name (SavedClips), the complete path will be created by the program using the
path of the trigger file (if it is a file) or folder. Videos are stored in folder specified by --output. Videos from all
the folders are then merged into 1 folder with name TeslaDashcam followed by timestamp of processing (timestamp is
added automatically). Chapter offset is set to be 2 minutes (120 seconds) before the end of the respective folder clips.

* Windows:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam.exe --merge --chapter_offset -120 --output c:\Tesla\TeslaDashcam.mp4 --monitor --monitor_trigger x:\TeslaCam\start_processing.txt SavedClips

* Mac:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam --merge --chapter_offset -120 --output /Users/me/Desktop/Tesla --monitor --monitor_trigger /Users/me/TeslaCam/start_processing.txt SavedClips

* Linux:

.. code:: bash

    python3 tesla_dashcam.py --merge --chapter_offset -120 --output /home/me/Tesla --monitor --monitor_trigger /home/me/TeslaCam/start_processing.txt SavedClips


Start and End Timestamps
-------------------------

By providing either (or both) a start timestamp (--start_timestamp) and/or a end timestamp (--end_timestamp) one can restrict what is being
processed and thus what is being output in the video files based on date/time. The provided timestamps do not have to match a specific timestamp
of a folder or even of a clip. If the provided timestamp falls within a video clip then the portion of the clip that falls outside of the timestamp(s)
will be skipped.
The format for the timestamp is any valid ISO-8601 format. For example:
2019 to process restrict video to year 2019.
2019-09 for September, 2019.
2019-09-10 or 20190910 for 10th of September, 2019
2019-W37 (or 2019W37) for week 37 in 2019
2019-W37-2 (or 2019W372) for Tuesday (day 2) of Week 37 in 2019
2019-253 (or 2019253) for day 253 in 2019 (which is 10th of September, 2019)

To identify the time, one can use hh, hh:mm, or hh:mm:ss.
If providing both a date and a time then these are seperated using the letter T:
2019-09-10T11:15:10 for 11:15AM on the 10th of September, 2019.

By default the timezone will be the local timezone. For UTC time add the letter Z to the time: 2019-09-10T11:15:10Z for 11:15AM on the 10th of September, 2019 UTC time.
One can also use +hh:mm, +hhmm, +hh, -hh:mm, -hhmm, -hh to use a different timezone. 2019-09-10T11:15:10-0500 is for 11:15AM on the 10th of September, 2019 EST.

For further guidance also see: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html

Start and End Offsets
-------------------------
Using the parameters --start_offset and --end_offset one can set at which point the processing of the clips within the folder should start. The value provided is in seconds.
For example, to skip the 1st 5 minutes of each event (an event being the collection of video files within 1 folder) one can provide --start_offset 300.
Similar, to skip the last 30 seconds of an event one can use --end_offset 30.
The offsets are done for each folder (event) independently. Thus if processing 8 folders and a --start_offset 420 then 8 files will be
created and each will be about 3 minutes long (as each folder normally has 10 minutes worth of video). If using --merge then the resulting merged video files will be 24 minutes long.

The offsets are calculated before speed-up or slow-down of the video. Hence using --start_offset 420 --speed_up 2 would still result in the offset being at 7 minutes.


Argument (Parameter) file
-------------------------

It is also possible to supply a text file with all the respective arguments (parameters) instead of having to enter them each time on the command line.
Arguments within the text file can all be on one (1) line, on separate lines, or a combination thereof.

Having a text file (i.e. my_preference.txt) with the following contents:

.. code:: bash

    --speedup 10 --rear
    --merge --output /home/me/Tesla
    --monitor_once SavedClips

And then executing tesla_dashcam as follows:

* Windows:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam.exe @my_preference.txt

* Mac:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam @my_preference.txt

* Linux:

.. code:: bash

    python3 tesla_dashcam.py @my_preference.txt

Would result in the same as if those parameters were provided on the command itself. One can also combine a parameter file with parameters on the command line.
Preference is given to what occurs first. For example, if providing the following arguments:

.. code:: bash

    --speedup 2 @my_preference.txt

Then the clips will only be sped up two-fold instead of 10-fold as --speedup 2 occurs before --speedup 10 from the parameter file.
But with:

.. code:: bash

    @my_preference.txt --speedup 2

the clips will be sped up ten-fold.

    - New: Added option --rear to show video from side cameras as if one was looking to the rear of the car. This was how it was originally.
    - New: Added option to swap left and right camera in output. Mostly beneficial in FULLSCREEN with --rear option as it then seems like it is from a rear camera
    - New: Added option to speedup (--speedup) or slowdown (--slowdown) the video.

    - Changed: For output (--output) one can now also just specify a folder name. The resulting filename will be based on the name of the folder it is then put in
    - Changed: If there is only 1 video file for merging then will now just rename intermediate (or copy if --keep-intermediate is set).
    - Changed: The intermediate files (combining of the 3 cameras into 1 video file per minute) will now be written to the output folder if one provided.
    - Changed: The intermediate files will be deleted once the complete video file is created. This can be disabled through option --keep-intermediate

    - Fixed: combining clips to movie would not use GPU or provided encoding.
    - Fixed: Added additional check that video file exist before merging into movie.
0.1.10:
    - New: Added scale option to set the scale of the clips and thus resulting video. (--scale)
    - New: Added option to specify a parameter file using @<filename> where parameters can be located in. (@<filename>)

    - New: Individual file(s) can now be provided as a source as well (only 1 camera filename has to be provided to get all 3)
    - New: Source is now optional, if not provided then it will be same as --monitor_once with as source SavedClips.
    - Changed: Timestamp within video will now be used for concatenation of the clips at folder level and all (--merge option) instead of filename. This will ensure that even when crossing timezones the order of the video is still accurate.
    - Changed: --delete_source will delete source files when specified even when --monitor or --monitor_once is not specified `Issue #28 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/28>`_
    - Changed: output will default to Videos\Tesla_Dashcam (Windows) Movies/Tesla_Dashcam (MacOS), or Videos\Tesla_Dashcam (Linux) if not output folder specified.

    - Changed: Updated release notes for each release better identifying what is new, changed, and fixed.
    - Fixed: issue where sometimes encoding with GPU would fail by also allowing software based encoding
    - Fixed: traceback when unable to retrieve latest release from GitHub
    - Fixed: running tesla_dashcam when installed using pip. `Issue #23 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/23>`_ and `Issue #31 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/31>`_
    - Fixed: Folder clip would be removed if only 1 set in folder with same name as folder name if keep_intermediate not specified
    - Fixed: Font issue in Windows (hopefully final fix) `Issue #29 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/29>`_
    - Fixed: Python version has to be 3.7 or higher due to use of capture_output `Issue #19 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/19>`_

    - Fixed: Traceback when getting ffmpeg path in Linux `Issue #39 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/39>`_
    - Fixed: Running tesla_dashcam when installed using pip. `Issue #38 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/38>`_
    - Fixed: Just providing a filename for output would result in traceback.
    - Fixed: When providing a folder as output it would be possible that the last folder name was stripped potentially resulting in error.

    - New: Added chapter markers in the concatenated movies. Folder ones will have a chapter marker for each intermediate clip, merged one has a chapter marker for each folder.
    - New: Option --chapter_offset for use with --merge to offset the chapter marker in relation to the folder clip.
    - New: Added flag -movstart +faststart for video files better suited with browsers etc. (i.e. YouTube). Thanks to sf302 for suggestion.
    - New: Option to add trigger (--monitor_trigger_file) to use existence of a file/folder/link for starting processing instead of USB/SD being inserted.
    - Changed: Method for concatenating the clips together has been changed resulting in massive performance improvement (less then 1 second to do concatenation). Big thanks to sf302!
    - Fixed: Folders will now be deleted if there are 0-byte or corrupt video files within the folder `Issue #40 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/40>`_
    - Fixed: Providing a filename for --output would create a folder instead and not setting resulting file to filename provided `Issue #52 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/52>`_
    - Fixed: Thread exception in Windows that ToastNotifier does not have an attribute classAtom (potential fix). `Issue #54 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/54>`_
    - Fixed: Traceback when invalid output path (none-existing) is provided or when unable to create target folder in given path.
    - Fixed: Including sub dirs did not work correctly, it would only grab the 1st folder.
    - Fixed: When using monitor, if . was provided as source then nothing would be processed. Now it will process everything as intended.
    - Fixed: File created when providing a filename with --output and --monitor option did not put timestamp in filename to ensure unique filenames
    - Fixed: Argument to get release notes was provided incorrectly when checking for updates. Thank you to demonbane for fixing.
0.1.13:
    - New: Support for rear camera (introduced in V10). This also results in layouts having been modified to allow inclusion of rear camera. `Issue #71 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/71>`_
    - New: Support for hardware encoding for systems with supported Intel GPUs.
    - New: Support for hardware encoding on Raspberry Pi (RPi) (H.264 only) `Issue #66 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/66>`_
    - New: Layout CROSS with front camera top centered, side camera underneath it, and rear camera then underneath side cameras centered.
    - New: Layout DIAMOND with front camera top centered, rear camera under front and side camera centered at the left and right of front&rear.
    - New: Option --motion_only to fast-forward through the portions in the video that does not have anything motion (done through removal of duplicate frames). Thanks to supRy for providing this
    - New: Option --skip_existing to skip creation of video files that already exist. Existence only is checked, not if layout etc are the same.
    - New: Option --perspective for showing side cameras to be displayed in perspective mode irrespective of layout. Layout PERSPECTIVE is thus same as layout FULLSCREEN with --perspective option.
    - New: Options --start_offset and --end_offset can be used to provide starting and ending offset in seconds for resulting video (at folder level).
    - New: Options --start_timestamp and --end_timestamp can be used to restrict resulting video (and processing) to specific timestamps. This can be used in combination with --start_offset and/or --end_offset
    - New: Options --no-front, --no-left, --no-right, and --no-rear to exclude camera(s) from the videos
    - New: Option --gpu_type to provide GPU installed in the system for Windows/Linux. Current supported options are nvidia, intel, and RPi.
    - New: Option  --no-faststart for not setting the faststart flag in the video files as doing this can result in encoding failures on network shares `Issue #62 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/62>`_
    - New: Option --temp_dir to provide a different path to store the temporary video files that are created `Issue #67 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/67>`_
    - New: Description metadata to include video was created by tesla_dashcam with version number.
    - Changed: WIDESCREEN layout will now by default show the front camera on top with higher resolution compared to others due to incorporation of rear camera
    - Changed: Include folder SentryClips in default source list if no source provided (SavedClips was already default).
    - Changed: Check to ensure that Python version is at required level or higher (currently 3.7).
    - Changed: Existence of font file (provided or default) will be checked and error returned if not existing.
    - Changed: Existence of ffmpeg will be checked and error returned if not existing.
    - Changed: If no filename provided for merged video then current date/time will be used for filename.
    - Fixed: Merge of videos fails when a relative path instead of an absolute path is provided for --output `Issue #62 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/62>`_
    - Fixed: Issue during processing of metadata if files were missing
    - Fixed: Hidden files (files starting with period) on Mac/Linux were not ignored. This could cause issues as some programs might create these files when viewing the video.
0.1.14:
    - Fixed: Checking if font path exist in Windows failed.
0.1.15:
    - Changed: Reduced sensitivity for motion detection
    - Changed: Minor improvement for font path checking, mainly message provided.
    - Fixed: Rear view camera filename was changed from -rear_view to -back in TeslaCam folders. `Issue #78 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/78>`_
    - Fixed: Missing python-dateutil package when installing from PIP `Issue #77 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/77>`_
    - Fixed: Missing fonts in Docker Image (thanks to moorecp for providing fix)
    - Fixed: Only the 1st source was processed When using MONITOR or MONITOR_ONCE, or with V10 only SavedClips was processed when not providing a source
0.1.16:
    - Changed: View of rear camera will be mirrored as well if side cameras are shown as mirror
    - Changed: For all layouts default is to show mirror for rear&side if front camera is shown, otherwise show as rear viewing.
    - Changed: Default is to swap left&right cameras when showing rear&side as rear viewing, and not to swap them when showing rear&side as mirror view.
