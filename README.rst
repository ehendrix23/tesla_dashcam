tesla_dashcam
=============

Python program that provides an easy method to merge saved Tesla Dashcam footage into a single video.

When saving Tesla Dashcam footage a folder is created on the USB drive for each event and within it multiple MP4 video files are
created. Currently the dashcam leverages four (4) cameras (front, rear, left repeater, and right repeater) and will create a
file for each of them. Every minute is stored into a separate file as well. This means that when saving dashcam footage
there is a total of 40 files video files for every 10 minutes, each event of 10 minutes is put into a separate folder.

Using this program, one can combine the 40 video files of an event into one (1), and combine video of multiple events together.
The layout of the four (4) different cameras within the resulting video can be determined by choosing one of the available layouts.

This program has multiple options providing a high level of flexibility on the videos to process, cameras to include,
layout of the resulting videos, location, format, encoding, .... See usage section below to read upon all the possibilities.

**Video Input** provides options related to the source videos.

*Trigger Monitor* is to have processing of videos not start upon execution of the program but instead be based on a trigger
(i.e. inserting the USB/SD card in the PC).

**Video Layout** provides parameters to define what the resulting video should look like. There are 4 different layouts to
choose from. This can then be further adjusted by having the left/right cameras be in perspective or not. Swap left/right
or front/rear cameras, change the scale for all cameras and/or for certain cameras, make left/right/rear seem as if you
were watching it through a mirror, or as if you turn your head around and looking backwards.

**Camera Exclusion** exclude certain cameras from the resulting video.

**Timestamp** options allow you to define what the timestamp in the resulting video should look like, or just to not have
it display at all.

**Timestamp Restriction** provides with the possibility to only create a video of the portion that are important. Instead
of uploading a video where the first 5 minutes is nothing, specify the start and end timestamps to shorten the video
to the important section instead.

**Event offsets** allows you to skip a portion from the start (and/or the end) for each event.

**Video Output** then further defines what the output should look like. Fast-forward through the Sentry video where nothing
is happening, speed up or slow down the video, ...

**Advanced encoding settings** allows you to further define additional encoding settings

And **Update Check** will make sure you always have the latest version available.

Notes
-----

The video files for the same minute between the 4 cameras are not always the same length. If there is a difference in
their duration then the background color (black by default) will be shown for the camera which video ended before the
others (within the minute).
It is thus possible within a video to see the background color for one of the cameras, and then when that minute has passed
for it to show video again.

The date and time shown within the video comes from the timestamp embedded in the saved videos themselves, not from the
filename. Date and time shown within resulting videos is converted to timezone set upon the PC it is being run on.


Requirements
-------------

This package relies on `ffmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org>`__ to be installed, this is a free, open source cross-platform
solution to convert video. The created executables for Windows and MacOS include an ffmpeg version.

If not using the executables (Windows and MacOS) then `Python <https://www.python.org>`__ 3.7 or higher is required.


Installation
-------------

Downloading the respective bundle (ZIP for Windows, DMG for MacOS) and unpacking this in a location of your choosing is
sufficient to install this.

If downloading the source files (i.e. for Linux) then Python has to be installed as well. I recommend in that case to
install the package from pypi using pip to ensure all package requirements (except for ffmpeg) are met.

This package is available from `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/tesla-dashcam/>`__.

Install from pypi is done through:

.. code:: bash

    python3 -m pip install tesla_dashcam

    Advanced encoding settings:
      Advanced options for encoding

      --gpu                 Use GPU acceleration, only enable if supported by hardware.
                            MAC: All MACs with Haswell CPU or later support this (Macs after 2013).
                                  See following link as well:
                                    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Macintosh_models_grouped_by_CPU_type#Haswell
                            (default: False)
      --gpu_type {nvidia,intel,RPi}
                            Type of graphics card (GPU) in the system. This determines the encoder that will be used.This
                            parameter is mandatory if --gpu is provided. (default: None)
      --no-faststart        Do not enable flag faststart on the resulting video files. Use this when using a network share and     
                            errors occur during encoding. (default: False)
      --quality {LOWEST,LOWER,LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH}
                            Define the quality setting for the video, higher quality means bigger file size but might not be       
                            noticeable. (default: LOWER)
      --compression {ultrafast,superfast,veryfast,faster,fast,medium,slow,slower,veryslow}
                            Speed to optimize video. Faster speed results in a bigger file. This does not impact the quality of    
                            the video, just how much time is used to compress it. (default: medium)
      --fps FPS             Frames per second for resulting video. Tesla records at about 33fps hence going higher wouldn't do     
                            much as frames would just be duplicated. Default is 24fps which is the standard for movies and TV      
                            shows (default: 24)
      --ffmpeg FFMPEG       Path and filename for ffmpeg. Specify if ffmpeg is not within path. (default:
                            d:\src\tesla_dashcam\tesla_dashcam\ffmpeg.exe)
      --encoding {x264,x265}
                            Encoding to use for video creation.
                                x264: standard encoding, can be viewed on most devices but results in bigger file.
                                x265: newer encoding standard but not all devices support this yet.
      --enc ENC             Provide a custom encoder for video creation. Cannot be used in combination with --encoding.
                            Note: when using this option the --gpu option is ignored. To use GPU hardware acceleration specify an encoding that provides this.

    Update Check:
      Check for updates

      --check_for_update    Check for update and exit. (default: False)
      --no-check_for_update
                            A check for new updates is performed every time. With this parameter that can be disabled (default:    
                            False)
      --include_test        Include test (beta) releases when checking for updates. (default: False)

Positional Argument
-------------------

Source does not have a specific parameter. Just provide the folder(s) to be scanned and processed. One can provide
folder(s) and/or file(s) here. Source is not mandatory, if not provided then the default will be SavedClips and SentryClips.
The path searches for SavedClips and SentryClips will depend if there was a Trigger Monitor parameter provided or not.
If source is not provided and no Trigger Monitor provided then --monitor_once will be enabled with SavedClips and SentryClips.


Optional Arguments
------------------

These are some other optional arguments that don't change in what will be processed, how, layout, resulting video file
or so.

*-h or --help*

  Show the help message and exit.

*--version*

  Show the version number of the program and exit.

*--loglevel <level>*

  Log level for additional output. Currently only used for DEBUG, providing any other value will not change anything.

*--temp_dir <path>*

  Temporary path to store the temporary (intermediate) clip video files. When processing a temporary video file is
  created for each minute within an event folder combining the different cameras together. Then these temporary video
  files are merged together to produce the resulting event video file. By default the temporary clip video files will
  be stored in the same folder as specified where the resulting video file will be stored. Using this parameter one
  can thus specify another folder instead. Can be especially helpful when the resulting videos are being stored on
  a network share as one can then specify a local drive that would be faster for the temporary files.

*--no-notification*

  Upon completion a notification is provided on the screen that processing is completed. Use this parameter to
  disable this notification.

Video Input
-----------

Following options are to manage what should be processed and what to do once processed.

*--skip_existing*

  Default: False

  By default if a resulting video files already exist then it will be overwritten (except with --monitor). By providing this
  parameter if the resulting video file already exist then it will not be recreated. Note that this only checks for existence
  of the video file and not if the layout etc. of that video file matches current selection.

*--delete_source*

  Default: False

  Delete the clips (files) and events (folders) on the source once processing has been completed.

*--exclude_subdirs*

  Default: False

  Do not scan any subfolders within the source provided for valid clips.


Trigger Monitor
---------------

When the program is executed the provide source folders are being scanned for events and clip files, processed, and
then the program exits. Using these parameters it is possible however to start the program before the SD or USB has been
inserted and have it wait. It can then be set to wait again after first time processing or to stop.

*--monitor*

  Default: False

  Monitor for drive to be attached that has the TeslaCam folder in its root. If not already one attached then wait till
  one is attached. Once a drive with the TeslaCam folder is attached processing will start based on the source provided.
  If no source was provided then all events within SavedClips and SentryClips will be processed instead. To have it
  process all 3 folders then provide the following for source:

  SavedClips SentryClips RecentClips

  After processing the program will wait until the drive has been ejected from the system. Once ejected it will
  start monitoring again for a drive to be attached. This loop will continue until stopped with CTRL-C.

*--monitor_once*

  Default: False

  This is the same as --monitor however instead of waiting for the drive to be ejected after processing the program
  will stop.

*--monitor_trigger <File or folder>*

  Monitor for existence of a folder (or file) instead of a drive with TeslaCam folder. Once the file (or folder) exist
  then processing will start. If source is provided then that will be used for scanning for events and clips. If no
  source was provided then the path provided for this parameter will be used as source instead. If the provided source
  is a relative path (i.e. Tesla/MyVideos) then it will be relative based on the location of the trigger file/path.

  Upon completion, if a trigger file was provided then that file will be deleted and the program will wait again
  until the trigger file exist again. If a trigger folder was provided then the program will wait until this folder
  has been removed. Then it will start monitoring again for existence for this folder.


Video Layout
------------

The layout of the resulting video can be adjusted in many ways through multiple parameters. Parameter --layout
specifies where each camera clip should be placed within the resulting video. (see above for examples).

*--layout*

  Default: FULLSCREEN

* FULLSCREEN: Resolution: 1920x960

    +---------------+----------------+----------------+


*--perspective*

  Default: False

  Show the side cameras in perspective mode.


*--scale*

  This can then be further adjusted by changing the scale for all cameras or changing the scale for one or more making
  them smaller or bigger then the others. This is done with the --scale parameter. If just provided with a number then
  scale is multiplied based on that number.

  For example, 0.5 results in 640x480 as standard resolution is 1280x960. Or one can also provide the resolution instead
  of the scale. For example providing 640x480. Changing the scale can be done for specific cameras as well. This is
  done by preceding the scale number (or resolution) with camera=<camera> where <camera> can be front, rear, left,
  or right. One can provide the --scale parameter multiple times.

  For example:

  \-\-scale 1 --scale camera=left .25 --scale camera=right 640x480

  results in front and rear camera clips to be of size 1280x960, left camera would be 320x240, and right camera would
  be 640x480.


*--mirror or --rear*

  By default the left, right, and rear cameras are shown as if one is sitting inside the car and looking through the
  mirrors. However, if the front camera is not included (with option --no-front) then this is changed making it seem
  as if one is looking backwards and not through a mirror. With option --mirror or --rear one can override the default
  for this.

  Using --rear you can thus make it so that it is shown as if looking backwards yet still having the front one shown.
  Same, using --mirror one can make it as if the view is shown through a mirror without showing the front camera.

*--swap or --no-swap*

  Default is to swap left and right cameras (left one is shown on the right in the video and right one is shown on the left)
  when they are viewed as if looking backwards (see --rear). Using --no-swap this can then be overridden.


  Similar, when looking as if through a mirror the default is not to swap left and right cameras. With --swap this can be
  overridden.

*--swap_frontrear*

  Default: False

  Using this you can swap the front and the rear camera in the layouts. The front camera is normally on top with the rear
  camera being at the bottom. With this the front camera will be shown at the bottom and the rear on the top.

*--background*

  Default: Black

  Specify the background color for the video. Default is black. See --fontcolor for possible values.

Camera Exclusion
----------------

By default the output from all 4 cameras is shown within the merged video if existing. Using these parameters one can
exclude one or more cameras from the resulting video.

*--no-front*

  Default: False

  Exclude the front camera from the resulting video.

*--no-left*

  Default: False

  Exclude the left camera from the resulting video.

*--no-right*

  Default: False

  Exclude the right camera from the resulting video.

*--no-rear*

  Default: False

  Exclude the rear camera from the resulting video.

Text Overlay
---------

Following parameters are to change settings for the text that is being added to the resulting video.

*--text-overlay-fmt*

  Default: {local_timestamp_rolling}

  Sets the format string for the text overlayed in the video.
  Valid format specifiers:
  
  `local_timestamp_rolling`: Local time which continuously updates, string

  `local_timestamp`: Local time that does not continuously update, string

  `event_timestamp`: Timestamp from events.json (if provided), string

  `event_city`: City name from events.json (if provided), string

  `event_reason`: Recording reason from events.json (if provided), string

  `event_latitude`: Estimated latitude from events.json (if provided), float

  `event_longitude`: Estimated longitude from events.json (if provided), float


*--no-timestamp*

  Default: False

  Do not display timestamp within the resulting video.

*--halign*

  Default: CENTER

  Determine the horizontal alignment of the timestamp within the resulting video. The default for this normally
  is to display the timestamp in the center of the video. Exception to this is for DIAMOND layout when excluding
  left or right camera in which case the horizontal placement of the font is adjusted so that it is still displayed
  between the front and rear camera. The alignment can be overridden with:

  LEFT: place timestamp to the left of the video

  CENTER: place timestamp in the center of the video

  RIGHT: place timestamp to the right of the video

*--valign*

  Default: BOTTOM

  Set the vertical alignment of the timestamp within the resulting video. Default is at the bottom of the video except
  for layout DIAMOND where it is in the middle to be placed in the space between the front and rear camera.

  TOP: place timestamp at the top of the video

  MIDDLE: place timestamp in the middle of the video

  BOTTOM: place timestamp at the bottom of the video

*--font <filename>*

  Override the default font for the timestamp. Filename/path provided here has to be a fully qualified filename to the
  font file (.ttf).

*--fontsize <size>*

  Font size for the timestamp. Default font size is scaled based on the resulting video size, use this to override and
  provide a fix font size.

*--fontcolor <color*

  Default: white

  The color for the timestamp as a color string or RGB value. More information on how to provide the color can be
  found here: `https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-utils.html#Color <https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-utils.html#Color>`_

  Some possible values are:
    white

    yellowgreen

    yellowgreen@0.9

    Red

    0x2E8B57


Timestamp Restriction
---------------------

The events/clips to be processed and thus be put in the resulting video can be restricted by providing a start and/or
end timestamp.

The timestamps provided do not need to match the start or end timestamp of a specific event or specific clip. Video within
the clip will be skipped if it falls outside of the timestamp.

By default the timestamp will be interpreted based on the timezone of the PC the program runs on. This can be
overridden however.

The timestamp is to be provided based on the ISO-8601 format (see
`https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/iso-time.html <https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/iso-time.html>`_) for description and examples of
this format.

In general, the date is provided in the format YYYY, YYYY-MM, YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-Wxx, YYYY-ddd

Here are some examples:

  2019 to process restrict video to year 2019.

  2019-09 for September, 2019.

  2019-09-10 or 20190910 for 10th of September, 2019

  2019-W37 (or 2019W37) for week 37 in 2019

  2019-W37-2 (or 2019W372) for Tuesday (day 2) of Week 37 in 2019

  2019-253 (or 2019253) for day 253 in 2019 (which is 10th of September, 2019)

To identify the time, one can use hh, hh:mm, or hh:mm:ss.
If providing both a date and a time then these are seperated using the letter T:

  2019-09-10T11:15:10 for 11:15AM on the 10th of September, 2019.

Timezone for the timestamp can be provided as well.
  For UTC time add the letter Z to the time: 2019-09-10T11:15:10Z for 11:15AM on the 10th of September, 2019 UTC time.

One can also use +hh:mm, +hhmm, +hh, -hh:mm, -hhmm, -hh to use a different timezone.

  2019-09-10T11:15:10-0500 is for 11:15AM on the 10th of September, 2019 EST.

For further guidance on potential values see: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html

*--start_timestamp <timestamp>*

  Starting timestamp to include in resulting video. Anything before this timestamp will be skipped (even when inside
  the clip containing the starting timestamp).

*--end_timestamp <timestamp>*

  Ending timestamp to include in resulting video. Anything after this timestamp will be skipped (even when inside
  the clip containing the ending timestamp).

Event offsets
-------------

This is to skip forward or stop earlier within an event. The skipping is done for each event (folder) individually.
For example, one can set it to skip the 1st 5 minutes of each event by providing the --start_offset 300 (300 seconds = 5 minutes).
Provided offsets are calculated before any video adjustments such as speeding up, slowing down, or motion only. Offsets
can work in combination with the timestamp restriction however the offsets will always be calculated based on the event
start and end timestamps. Thus if the start timestamp is set to be 2 minutes into the event, and the offset is set to 5 minutes
then the resulting video will start 5 minutes in (and not 7 minutes into the event). If the start timestamp is 3 minutes into
the event, and the starting offset is set to 2 minutes then the resulting video will start at 3 minutes in. Same
methodology is applied for ending offset and end timestamp.

*--start_offset <offset>*

  Starting offset within the event. <offset> is in seconds.

*--end_offset <offset>*

  Ending offset within the event. <offset> is in seconds.

Video Output
------------

These are additional parameters related to the resulting video creation.

*--output <path/filename>*

  Path/filename for the resulting video. If a filename is provided here and --merge is set then the resulting merged
  video will be saved with this filename. The event videos will be stored within the same folder.

*--motion_only*

  Default: False

  Resulting video will show fast forwarded video for any portion where there is no or very little motion. This can
  be especially useful for Sentry events since those are 10-minute events but often only have a few minutes (if that)
  of useful activity in it that resulted in the event being created.

*--slowdown <speed>*

  Slow the resulting video down by provided multiplier. For example, a <speed> of 2 would mean that the video
  will be half the speed of normal.

*--speedup <speed>*

  Increase the speed of the resulting video by provided multiplier. For example, a value of 2 means that the video
  will be going twice the normal speed.

*--chapter_offset <seconds>*

  Sets an offset for the chapter markers in the merged video. By default a chapter marker is set at the start of each
  event within the merged video. Using this one can set the chapter marker <seconds> before or after the start of the event.

  Providing a negative value here results in the chapter marker being set x number of seconds before the end of the event.

  Providing a positive value results in the chapter marker being set x number of seconds after the start of the event.

*--merge*

  Default: False

  A video file is created for each event (folder) found. When parameter --merge is provided these individual event
  video files will then be further merged into 1 bigger video file.

*--keep-intermediate*

  Default: False

  Temporary video files are being created during the processing of the events. These temporary video files are the
  combined camera clips for 1 minute, and thus normally 10 of these video files are created (one for each minute).
  These files are then deleted once the event is processed and the event video file has been created. Use this
  parameter to keep these temporary video files instead. Note that depending on the number of events a lot more
  storage will be required then.

Advanced Encoding Settings
--------------------------

The following parameters are more advanced settings to determine how ffmpeg should encode the videos.

*--gpu or --no-gpu*

  Determine if GPU acceleration should be used or not. On MACs the default is to use GPU acceleration whereas on all
  other platforms the default is not to use GPU acceleration (this is because the encoder being used on other
  platforms is depending then on the GPU installed in the PC).

  For Macs, use --no-gpu to disable using the GPU for encoding, note that encoding will use a lot more CPU and will
  end up being slower.

  For all other platforms, use --gpu to enable GPU encoding. When enabling you will also need to provide the GPU
  installed within the system (see --gpu_type).

  Note, --gpu option is only available on non-Macs whereas option --no-gpu is only available on Macs!

*--gpu_type*

  All platforms except Macs. Provide the GPU type installed in the system.

    intel: if INTEL GPU is installed

    nvidia: if NVIDIA GPU is installed

    RPi: on Raspberry Pi systems

*--no-faststart*

   Default: False

   By default the ffmpeg flag faststart is set. Doing this will ensure that certain meta data is placed at the start
   of the resulting video which then improves streaming (i.e. YouTube, WebSites, ...). This parameter is to disable
   this and thus having the meta data placed at the end of the video file (which is normal default). This can improve
   performance as video files will not have to be rewritten after processing to put the metadata at the beginning of the
   file, and it can also prevent issues with video files are located on a network share.

*--quality*

  Default: LOWER

  Set the overall quality for the resulting video. Setting this to a higher value can improve the quality (not guaranteed)
  but most likely will also result in bigger file sizes. Resulting improvement might not be noticeable.

    Valid values: LOWEST, LOWER, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH

*--compression*

  Default: medium

  Defines how much time should be spend to compress the resulting video file. Slower speed can result in improved
  compression of the video file and thus a smaller video size. However it would also result in longer processing time.

    ultrafast will result in least amount of time processing to compress the video file, but largest video size.

    veryslow will result in the smallest video file, but the longest amount of time to create the video file.

  Note that increasing or decreasing compression time will not impact the quality of the resulting video. Just the
  resulting file size.

    Valid values: ultrafast, superfast,veryfast,faster,fast,medium,slow,slower,veryslow

*--fps <frames>*

  Default: 24

  Set the frames per seconds for the resulting video. Default frames per second for movies and TV shows is 24fps. Tesla
  cameras are recording and saving at about 33fps. Using default about 9 frames per second are dropped from the resulting
  video. With this parameter the fps for the resulting video can be adjusted. Set it to 33 to keep the number of frames
  similar to Tesla's. Setting this value higher would just result in frames being duplicated. For example, setting it to
  66 would mean that for every second, each frame is duplicated to get from 33fps to 66fps.

*--ffmpeg <executable>*

  For Windows and MacOS an executable is delivered with FFMPEG build-in. When using this executable this parameter
  can be easily ignored unless one wants to specify a different ffmpeg version then what is delivered.

  On all other platforms (or on Windows and MacOS when not using the executable) ffmpeg has to be downloaded and
  installed separately. If ffmpeg is within the search path (on most platforms defined through environment variable PATH)
  then there is also no reason to provide this. If ffmpeg is not within the search path (or one wants to use a different
  ffmpeg then what is provided in the executable) then one can provide the fully qualified name for the ffmpeg to be used.

*--encoding*

  Default: x264

  Provide the encoding for the resulting video. Default is x264 as today this is still the most common format for
  video files. One can also encode it in x265 which is the newer video standard. Encoding in x265 results in a smaller
  video file however certain programs or platforms might not be able to view this yet. Use x264 if providing the
  video to a wide audience, you can use x265 for private usage and ability to view x265.

    Valid values: x264, x265

*--enc <encoder>*

  ffmpeg uses an encoder to create (encode) the video files. By default the encoder selected is based on platform
  (Windows, Mac, Linux), GPU acceleration and GPU type, and encoding (x264, x265). With this parameter it is possible
  to provide a different encoder instead to create the video file. For further information please see the ffmpeg
  documentation on video encoders. The value provided here will be provided to parameter c:v <encoder>

Update Check
------------

A check to determine if a newer version is available will be performed every time the program is executed. These
parameters allow you to influence this.

*--check_for_update*

  Check if there is a new update available and then just exit. This allows you to perform the check without processing
  anything.

*--no-check_for_update*

  Default: False

  Do not perform the check if there is an update available. Not recommended as no checks are performed, but can be
  used when there is no internet available, slow internet, ...

*--include_test*

  Default: False

  Include test (beta) releases when checking for new updates. If this parameter is provided then it will also include
  any beta releases. Note that it has to be an actual beta releases within releases. Sometimes the development branch
  can have releases that have not been released as a test release.


Argument (Parameter) file
-------------------------

A lot of different parameters can be provided, thus to make it easier one can have these parameters within a text file
and then supply this text file instead of having to enter them each time on the command line. Combination of
having parameters in a text file and supplying it together with additional parameters on the command line is possible
as well. This thus allows having multiple text files based on different preferences (i.e. layouts, ...) and still
provide other parameters (i.e. start_timestamp and end_timestamp) on the command line.

Arguments within the text file can all be on one (1) line, on separate lines, or a combination thereof. Use # to identify
comments. Everything behind # on a line is then ignored.
Note, on Windows the argument specifying the parameter file has to be between double quotes (")

Having a text file (i.e. my_preference.txt) with the following contents:

.. code:: bash

    --speedup 10 --rear
    --merge --output /home/me/Tesla
    --monitor_once SavedClips

And then executing tesla_dashcam as follows:

* Windows:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam.exe "@my_preference.txt"

* Mac:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam @my_preference.txt

* Linux:

.. code:: bash

    python3 tesla_dashcam.py @my_preference.txt

Would result in the same as if those parameters were provided on the command itself. One can also combine a parameter file with parameters on the command line.
Preference is given to what occurs first. For example, if providing the following arguments:

.. code:: bash

    --speedup 2 @my_preference.txt

Then the clips will only be sped up two-fold instead of 10-fold as --speedup 2 occurs before --speedup 10 from the parameter file.
But with:

.. code:: bash

    @my_preference.txt --speedup 2

the clips will be sped up ten-fold.

    python3 tesla_dashcam.py --layout FULLSCREEN --fontsize 24 /home/me/Tesla/2019-02-27_14-02-03

Specify location of ffmpeg binay (in case ffmpeg is not in path):

* Windows:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam.exe --ffmpeg c:\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe c:\Tesla\2019-02-27_14-02-03

* Mac:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam --ffmpeg /Applications/ffmpeg /Users/me/Desktop/Tesla/2019-02-27_14-02-03

* Linux:

.. code:: bash

    python3 tesla_dashcam.py --ffmpeg /home/me/ffmpeg /home/me/Tesla/2019-02-27_14-02-03

Layout of PERSPECTIVE with a different font for timestamp and path for ffmpeg:

* Windows: Note how to specify the path, : and \ needs to be escaped by putting a \ in front of them.

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam.exe --layout PERSPECTIVE --ffmpeg c:\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe --font "C\:\\Windows\\Fonts\\Courier New.ttf" c:\Tesla\2019-02-27_14-02-03

* Mac:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam --layout PERSPECTIVE --ffmpeg /Applications/ffmpeg --font '/Library/Fonts/Courier New.ttf' /Users/me/Desktop/Tesla/2019-02-27_14-02-03

* Linux:

.. code:: bash

    python3 tesla_dashcam.py --layout PERSPECTIVE --ffmpeg /Applications/ffmpeg --font '/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/Courier New.ttf' /home/me/Tesla/2019-02-27_14-02-03

Enable monitoring for the Tesla Dashcam USB (or SD) to be inserted and then process all the files (both RecentClips and SavedClips).
Increase speed of resulting videos tenfold and store all videos in folder specified by output.
Delete the source files afterwards:


.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam.exe --speed 10 --output c:\Tesla\ --monitor .

* Mac:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam /Users/me/Desktop/Tesla --monitor .

* Linux:

.. code:: bash

    python3 tesla_dashcam.py /home/me/Desktop/Tesla --monitor .


Enable one-time monitoring for the Tesla Dashcam USB (or SD) to be inserted and then process all the files from SavedClips.
Note that for source we provide the folder name (SavedClips), the complete path will be created by the program.
Slowdown speed of resulting videos to half, show left/right cameras as if looking backwards, store all videos in folder specified by output.
Also create a movie file that has them all merged together.

* Windows:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam.exe --slowdown 2 --rear --merge --output c:\Tesla\ --monitor_once SavedClips

* Mac:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam --slowdown 2 --rear --merge --output /Users/me/Desktop/Tesla --monitor_once SavedClips

* Linux:

.. code:: bash

    python3 tesla_dashcam.py --slowdown 2 --rear --merge --output /home/me/Tesla --monitor_once SavedClips

Enable monitoring using a trigger file (or folder) to start processing all the files from SavedClips.
Note that for source we provide the folder name (SavedClips), the complete path will be created by the program using the
path of the trigger file (if it is a file) or folder. Videos are stored in folder specified by --output. Videos from all
the folders are then merged into 1 folder with name TeslaDashcam followed by timestamp of processing (timestamp is
added automatically). Chapter offset is set to be 2 minutes (120 seconds) before the end of the respective folder clips.

* Windows:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam.exe --merge --chapter_offset -120 --output c:\Tesla\TeslaDashcam.mp4 --monitor --monitor_trigger x:\TeslaCam\start_processing.txt SavedClips

* Mac:

.. code:: bash

    tesla_dashcam --merge --chapter_offset -120 --output /Users/me/Desktop/Tesla --monitor --monitor_trigger /Users/me/TeslaCam/start_processing.txt SavedClips

* Linux:

.. code:: bash

    python3 tesla_dashcam.py --merge --chapter_offset -120 --output /home/me/Tesla --monitor --monitor_trigger /home/me/TeslaCam/start_processing.txt SavedClips

0.1.8:
    - New: Added GPU hardware accelerated encoding for Mac and PCs with NVIDIA. On Mac it is enabled by default
    - New: Added option to have video from side cameras be shown as if one were to look at it through the mirror (option --mirror). This is now the default
    - New: Added option --rear to show video from side cameras as if one was looking to the rear of the car. This was how it was originally.
    - New: Added option to swap left and right camera in output. Mostly beneficial in FULLSCREEN with --rear option as it then seems like it is from a rear camera
    - New: Added option to speedup (--speedup) or slowdown (--slowdown) the video.
    - New: Added option to provide a different encoder for ffmpeg to use. This is for those more experienced with ffmpeg.
    - New: Added a default font path for Linux systems
    - New: Added --version to get the version number
    - New: Releases will now be bundled in a ZIP file (Windows) or a DMG file (MacOS) with self-contained executables in them. This means Python does not need to be installed anymore (located on github)
    - New: ffmpeg executable binary for Windows and MacOS added into respective bundle.
    - Changed: For output (--output) one can now also just specify a folder name. The resulting filename will be based on the name of the folder it is then put in
    - Changed: If there is only 1 video file for merging then will now just rename intermediate (or copy if --keep-intermediate is set).
    - Changed: The intermediate files (combining of the 3 cameras into 1 video file per minute) will now be written to the output folder if one provided.
    - Changed: The intermediate files will be deleted once the complete video file is created. This can be disabled through option --keep-intermediate
    - Changed: Set FULLSCREEN back as the default layout
    - Changed: Help output (-h) will show what default value is for each parameter
    - Changed: Cleaned up help output

    - Fixed: Fixed (I believe) cygwin path for fonts.
0.1.9:
    - New: Added scanning of sub-folders clip files. Each folder will be processed and resulting movie file created. This can be disabled through parameter --exclude_subdirs
    - New: Added option to merge the video files from multiple sub-folders into 1 movie file. Use parameter --merge to enable.
    - New: Added option to monitor if the USB drive (or SD card) is inserted in the PC and then automatically start processing the files. Use parameter --monitor to enable.
      Parameter --monitor_once will stop monitoring and exit after 1st time drive was inserted.
      Parameter --delete_source will delete the source files and folder once the movie file for that folder has been created.
    - New: Added update checker to determine if there is a newer version, additional arguments to just perform check (--check_for_update), include test releases (--include_test), or disable always checking for updates (--no-check_for_update)
    - New: ffmpeg is part of the tesla_dashcam executable
    - New: Desktop notification when processing starts (when using monitor) and when it completes.
    - New: DockerFile added making it easy to run tesla_dashcam within Docker (jeanfabrice)
    - New: Time it took to create the video files will now be provided upon completion of processing.
    - Changed: Formatted output to easily show progress
    - Fixed: Will now handle it much better if a video file from a camera is corrupt (i.e. zero-byte file).
    - Fixed: combining clips to movie would not use GPU or provided encoding.
    - Fixed: Added additional check that video file exist before merging into movie.
0.1.10:

    - New: Source is now optional, if not provided then it will be same as --monitor_once with as source SavedClips.
    - Changed: Timestamp within video will now be used for concatenation of the clips at folder level and all (--merge option) instead of filename. This will ensure that even when crossing timezones the order of the video is still accurate.
    - Changed: --delete_source will delete source files when specified even when --monitor or --monitor_once is not specified `Issue #28 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/28>`_

    - Changed: Existence of ffmpeg will be checked and error returned if not existing.
    - Changed: If no filename provided for merged video then current date/time will be used for filename.
    - Fixed: Merge of videos fails when a relative path instead of an absolute path is provided for --output `Issue #62 <https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam/issues/62>`_
    - Fixed: Issue during processing of metadata if files were missing
    - Fixed: Hidden files (files starting with period) on Mac/Linux were not ignored. This could cause issues as some programs might create these files when viewing the video.
